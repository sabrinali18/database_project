# Web Application for Online Food Delivery Service

### Objective

The process of waiting in a line at a restaurant can be very
time-consuming. For the sake of saving time for workers who have to get food between
work, we believe that it is convenient to have a platform where people can order food
and/or make reservations. Using this application, users are able to see the restaurants
near them, with the information including address, delivery fee, phone number, etc.
After selecting one restaurant, users are able to see the dishes in this restaurant and
choose the food they would like to order. Users can then place their orders online so
that the restaurants are able to get the information, including dishes they have ordered,
delivery address, payment method, etc. Then the order will be assigned to a delivery
guy so that he can get the information of the order. Also, the customers can make
reservations through this application, with the number of guests and the reservation
time recorded. The set of our main entities include restaurants, users, orders, delivery
guy, reservations, and dishes. As different restaurants would have different dishes, we
set dishes as a separate entity and then link to the restaurants by the restaurant id that
they have.
