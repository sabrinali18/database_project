# Web Application for Online Food Delivery Service

### Objective

The process of waiting in a line at a restaurant can be very time-consuming. For the sake of saving time for workers who have to get food between work, we believe that it is convenient to have a platform where people can order food and/or make reservations. Therefore, we built this web application that allows users to order dishes and book seats from various resturants online.
